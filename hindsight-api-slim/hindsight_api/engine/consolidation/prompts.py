# Default mission when no bank-specific mission is set
_DEFAULT_MISSION = "Track every detail: names, numbers, dates, places, and relationships. Prefer specifics over abstractions, never generalise."

# Processing rules — always present regardless of mission
_PROCESSING_RULES = """Processing rules (always apply):

1. ONE OBSERVATION PER DISTINCT FACET: each observation tracks exactly one specific facet — a count ("has 3 items"), a named entity ("has a dog named Rex"), a relationship ("works at Google"), etc. Never merge different facets into one observation.

2. MATCH BY ENTITY/FACET, NOT TOPIC: when deciding whether to UPDATE vs CREATE, match on the specific entity or facet. "Sold item X" updates only the X observation. "Now has 5 items" updates only the count observation. Do not update observations about different entities just because they share a general topic.

3. STATE CHANGES — UPDATE CONCISELY: when a fact changes the state of something ("sold X", "X died", "moved to Y"), UPDATE the matching observation to reflect the current state. Include dates when available. Keep it concise — only information about THAT specific facet. Example: "User owned a dog named Rex who died on March 15, 2025". Do NOT pull in information from other observations — each observation stays focused on its own facet.

4. CASCADE TO ALL AFFECTED OBSERVATIONS: a state change may affect multiple observations. For example, if entity C is removed from a group, update BOTH the individual observation for C AND any list/group observation that includes C (remove C from the list while keeping all other members intact).

5. NO COMPUTATION: you do not have the full picture — never calculate, derive, or adjust numeric values. If the user says "I have 2 dogs" and then "I have a dog named Rex", do NOT update the count to 3 — you don't know if Rex is one of the 2 or a new one. If the user says "I sold X", do NOT decrement a count. Only update a count when the user explicitly states a new count. Synthesize and consolidate what was stated, but never do arithmetic or logical deductions.

6. SAME FACET → UPDATE, NOT CREATE: a new count supersedes the old count — UPDATE the existing count observation, don't create a second one. If there's an existing observation for the same specific facet, always UPDATE it rather than creating a duplicate.

7. PRESERVE HISTORY: observations that record significant events (sold, died, moved, changed) are important history — never DELETE them. Only delete an observation when it is restated identically or truly meaningless. Be very conservative with deletes.

8. RESOLVE REFERENCES: when a new fact provides a concrete value for a vague placeholder in an existing observation (e.g., "home country" → "Sweden"), UPDATE to embed the resolved value.

9. NEVER merge observations about different people or unrelated topics."""

# Data section — format placeholders {facts_text} and {observations_text} are substituted at call time
_BATCH_DATA_SECTION = """
NEW FACTS:
{facts_text}

EXISTING OBSERVATIONS (JSON array, pooled from recalls across all facts above):
{observations_text}

Each observation includes:
- id: unique identifier for updating
- text: the observation content
- proof_count: number of supporting memories
- occurred_start/occurred_end: temporal range of source facts
- source_memories: array of supporting facts with their text and dates

Compare the facts against existing observations:
- Same facet as an existing observation → UPDATE it (observation_id + source_fact_ids)
- New facet with durable knowledge → CREATE a new observation (source_fact_ids)
- Cross-reference facts within the batch: a later fact may resolve a vague reference in an earlier one
- Purely ephemeral facts → omit them unless the MISSION above explicitly targets such data (e.g. timestamped events, session state, screen content)"""

Output a JSON object with three arrays.

## EXAMPLE

Input facts:
[a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890] Alice mentioned she works long hours, often past midnight | Involving: Alice (occurred_start=2024-01-15, mentioned_at=2024-01-15)
[b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901] Alice said she's exhausted from the project deadlines | Involving: Alice (occurred_start=2024-01-20, mentioned_at=2024-01-20)

Good observation text — clean prose, no metadata, each fact tracked distinctly:
  "Alice works long hours, often past midnight."
  "Alice feels exhausted from project deadlines."

Bad observation text — NEVER do this (verbatim copy of fact text with metadata):
  "Alice mentioned she works long hours, often past midnight | Involving: Alice (occurred_start=2024-01-15, mentioned_at=2024-01-15)"

Observation text rules:
- Write clean prose — NEVER copy raw fact lines or their metadata (temporal fields, "Involving:", "When:" labels, UUIDs).
- Parenthesized metadata like (occurred_start=...) and pipe-separated labels like "| Involving: ..." are fact formatting — strip them entirely from observation text.
- How many observations to create and how much to aggregate is driven by the MISSION above.

{{"creates": [{{"text": "Alice works long hours, often past midnight.", "source_fact_ids": ["a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"]}}, {{"text": "Alice feels exhausted from project deadlines.", "source_fact_ids": ["b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901"]}}],

  "deletes": [{{"observation_id": "e5f6a7b8-c9d0-1234-efab-345678901234"}}]}}

Rules:
- "source_fact_ids": copy the EXACT UUID strings shown in brackets [uuid] from NEW FACTS — never use integers or positions.
- "observation_id": copy the EXACT "id" UUID string from EXISTING OBSERVATIONS.
- One create/update may reference multiple facts when they jointly support the observation.
- "deletes": only when an observation is directly superseded or contradicted by new facts.
- Do NOT include "tags" — handled automatically.
- Return {{"creates": [], "updates": [], "deletes": []}} if nothing durable is found."""
