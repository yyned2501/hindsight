![Omnigent with Hindsight persistent memory: recall, retain, and reflect across every harness](/img/blog/omnigent-persistent-memory.png)

Most agent memory integrations solve one problem for one tool. Add Hindsight to Cursor, and Cursor remembers. Add it to Aider, and Aider remembers. Each is its own setup, its own configuration, its own ceiling.

[Omnigent](https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent) breaks that pattern. It is a meta-harness: a single orchestration layer that wraps and coordinates multiple AI agents at once, including Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, and Pi. When you add Hindsight to Omnigent, you add persistent memory to **all of them through one place**, with a single setup instead of wiring up each tool's integration separately. And for any harness that has no native Hindsight integration, including custom ones, Omnigent is the memory layer. The bridge lives in Omnigent, so the agents inside it do not have to carry it themselves.

## TL;DR

- Omnigent ships three built-in memory tools: `hindsight_recall`, `hindsight_retain`, and `hindsight_reflect`.
- Omnigent **intercepts and executes these tools locally**, so every harness it wraps gets the same memory from one setup, including custom harnesses with no native Hindsight integration.
- Install is one optional extra: `pip install "omnigent[memory]"`.
- Wire up the tools in your agent's YAML spec, set `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY`, and the agent decides when to recall and retain.
- Memory persists across sessions and is scoped to a bank per agent (or per conversation, as a fallback).

## What makes this different from other integrations

Every Hindsight integration we have covered so far lives inside a single tool: Cursor hooks into VS Code's MCP layer, Aider wraps the CLI, Zed uses its global agent rules. Each works well for that tool and only for that tool.

Omnigent is different because it sits *above* the tools. It does not care which harness the agent calls underneath. When an agent running in Omnigent calls `hindsight_recall`, Omnigent intercepts it at the runner level, executes it locally using `hindsight-client`, and sends back the result. The wrapped harness, whether that is Claude Code, Codex, or a custom agent, never has to know how memory works.

Several of those harnesses also have their own native Hindsight integrations, and they are excellent when you run that tool on its own. The point of the Omnigent path is that you configure memory **once, centrally**, and it applies to every harness you orchestrate, plus the ones that have no native option at all. One Hindsight setup, any harness. That is the universal memory bridge.

## Install

The memory tools are an optional extra, so you only pull in what you need:

```bash
pip install "omnigent[memory]"
```

This adds `hindsight-client>=0.4.0` as the only dependency. You also need an API key from your [Hindsight Cloud](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) dashboard (or point at a self-hosted server):

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_KEY=hsk_...
```

## Wire up the tools in your agent spec

Omnigent agents are defined in YAML. Add the three tools under `tools.builtins`:

```yaml
name: my-agent
# ...rest of your agent spec

tools:
  builtins:
    - name: hindsight_recall
      api_key: ${HINDSIGHT_API_KEY}
      bank_id: my-agent-memory      # optional; defaults to agent_id
      budget: mid                   # low / mid / high
      max_tokens: 4096

    - name: hindsight_retain
      api_key: ${HINDSIGHT_API_KEY}
      bank_id: my-agent-memory

    - name: hindsight_reflect
      api_key: ${HINDSIGHT_API_KEY}
      bank_id: my-agent-memory
```

That is the entire setup. On next run, the three tools are available in the agent's tool list.

## How the tools work

Once wired up, the agent calls the tools explicitly. This is deliberate: Omnigent gives the agent the capability, and the agent decides when to use it. The standard pattern is to include this in your agent's system instructions:

```
- At the start of each task, call hindsight_recall with the user's request
  to load relevant decisions, preferences, and project context before answering.
- When the user gives you a durable fact (a convention, a decision, a preference),
  call hindsight_retain to store it.
- Call hindsight_reflect to synthesize what you know about a topic across sessions.
```

**`hindsight_recall`** runs a semantic search against your bank and returns the most relevant memories for the current message. The `budget` and `max_tokens` settings control how many tokens of memory are returned.

**`hindsight_retain`** stores a piece of information to the bank. The agent decides what is worth keeping; you can steer that with `tags` in the config if you want finer-grained filtering later.

**`hindsight_reflect`** synthesizes an answer from the accumulated observations in the bank. Useful for "what do we know about X?" queries that span many past sessions.

### How bank scoping works

Memory is isolated per bank. Omnigent resolves which bank to use in this order:

1. The explicit `bank_id` in your YAML config (most predictable, recommended for production).
2. The agent's `agent_id`: one bank per agent, shared across all conversations that agent has.
3. The `conversation_id`: one bank per conversation, wiped when the conversation ends.

If you run multiple agents in Omnigent and want them to share a memory (a shared project bank, for example), point them all at the same `bank_id`.

## A working example: the Remy agent

Omnigent ships a complete working example at `examples/remy/config.yaml`. Remy is a conversational assistant with all three memory tools wired up and instructions on when to call each one. Running it against Hindsight Cloud is one command:

```bash
HINDSIGHT_API_KEY=hsk_... omnigent run examples/remy
```

After a few conversations, try asking Remy something it learned in a previous session. It calls `hindsight_recall` against your question, finds the relevant memory, and answers from context it would have lost if memory were not there.

## Cloud or self-hosted

For **Hindsight Cloud**, the `api_key` in your spec plus your dashboard bank is all you need. The API URL defaults to `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io`.

For a **self-hosted** server, override the URL in config:

```yaml
- name: hindsight_recall
  api_url: http://localhost:8888
  bank_id: local-memory
```

An open local server needs no token.

## Which harnesses benefit

Any harness Omnigent wraps gets the memory tools, whether or not the harness has its own Hindsight integration:

| Harness | Native Hindsight integration | Via Omnigent |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Yes (official) | Yes |
| Cursor | Yes (official) | Yes |
| Codex | Yes (official) | Yes |
| OpenCode | Yes (official) | Yes |
| Pi | Yes (community, via epimetheus) | Yes |
| Custom harness | Usually none | Yes |

Most of these harnesses already have a native Hindsight integration, and each is a great choice when you run that tool standalone. What Omnigent adds is a single, central memory setup that applies across every harness you orchestrate at once, plus coverage for custom or in-house harnesses that have no native option. You configure memory in one place instead of once per tool.

## Omnigent's tools vs. a native integration

If a harness has both options, which should you use? Pick one path per bank. Do not enable a tool's native Hindsight integration **and** point Omnigent's memory tools at the same bank, or you will get two recall and retain paths writing the same conversation twice.

The tradeoff:

- **A native integration** is often automatic. It hooks the tool's own lifecycle so recall and retain happen without the agent thinking about it, but it is scoped to that one tool and configured per tool.
- **Omnigent's memory tools** are one central setup that works across every harness you orchestrate, but they are agent-driven: the agent calls them explicitly, guided by its system instructions.

A simple rule: reach for a tool's native integration when you run that tool on its own, and use Omnigent's memory tools when you are orchestrating multiple harnesses through Omnigent and want them to share one memory with one setup.

## Frequently asked questions

**Does Omnigent call recall and retain automatically?**
No. The agent calls the tools when its system instructions say to. This keeps the behavior transparent: you can read the agent spec and see exactly when memory operations happen.

**Can two agents share one bank?**
Yes. Set the same `bank_id` on both agents' tool configs and they read from and write to the same store. A fact one agent retains is available to the other on recall.

**Does memory survive switching harnesses?**
Yes. The bank lives in Hindsight, not in the harness. If you switch an Omnigent agent from Codex to Claude Code, the bank is exactly where it was.

**What does `hindsight_reflect` do that `hindsight_recall` doesn't?**
Recall retrieves memories relevant to a specific query. Reflect synthesizes across accumulated observations to reason about a topic, useful when you want a summary of what the agent has learned over many sessions, not just facts matching one query. Reflect also supports structured output via a `response_schema` field and can return the underlying facts it used to generate its answer.

**Can I filter recall to specific topics or users?**
Yes. The `recall_tags` and `recall_tags_match` config fields filter which memories are considered. Set `tags` on `hindsight_retain` to label what gets stored, and `recall_tags` on `hindsight_recall` to pull back only memories matching those labels. This is useful when one bank serves multiple users or projects.
