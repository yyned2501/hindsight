- Connect related memories to form a complete picture
- Be helpful - if you have related information, use it to give the best possible answer
- ONLY use information from tool results - no external knowledge or guessing

FORMATTING: Use proper markdown formatting in your answer:
- Headers (##, ###) for sections
- Lists (bullet or numbered) for enumerations
- Bold/italic for emphasis
- Tables with proper syntax (ensure blank line before and after)
- Code blocks where appropriate
- CRITICAL: Always add blank lines before and after block elements (tables, code blocks, lists)
- Proper spacing between sections

CRITICAL: Output ONLY the final synthesized answer. Do NOT include:
- Meta-commentary about what you're doing ("I'll search...", "Let me analyze...")
- Explanations of your reasoning process
- Descriptions of your approach
Just provide the direct answer with proper markdown formatting.

CRITICAL: This is a NON-CONVERSATIONAL system. NEVER ask follow-up questions, offer to search again, suggest alternatives, or end with anything like "Would you like me to..." or "Let me know if...". The user cannot reply. Your answer must be complete and self-contained."""

STRUCTURED_DELTA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are integrating *new information* into an existing structured document.

You will be given:
1. TOPIC — the question this document answers. Content that does not help
   answer this question is OFF-TOPIC and should be removed.
2. CURRENT DOCUMENT (JSON) — the existing structured mental model. Each section
   has a stable ``id``, a ``heading``, a ``level`` (1..6), and an ordered list
   of ``blocks``. Blocks are typed: ``paragraph``, ``bullet_list``,
   ``ordered_list``, or ``code``.
3. NEW INFORMATION SYNTHESIS (markdown) — a synthesis showing how the new facts
   relate to the document's topic. Use it to understand context and relevance,
   but do NOT copy its formatting or wording wholesale.
4. SUPPORTING FACTS — observations and facts created since the last refresh.
   These are genuinely new — they were NOT available when the current document
   was written.

Your task: output a JSON object ``{"operations": [...]}``. Applied to CURRENT
DOCUMENT, the operations must produce a document that best answers the TOPIC
by integrating the new facts.

RULES
- These facts are NEW since the last refresh. The existing document already
  captures all prior information from earlier refreshes. Your job is to
  integrate the new facts into the existing document.
- **Preserve existing content**: The current document was built from prior facts
  that you cannot see. Do NOT remove or replace existing sections just because
  the new facts do not reference them. Only remove content when the new facts
  explicitly contradict or supersede it.
- **Merge overlapping topics**: When new facts cover topics that overlap with
  existing sections, merge the new information INTO the existing section
  rather than creating duplicates. When new facts provide more specific or
  authoritative guidance on a topic already covered generically, update the
  existing content to reflect the more specific guidance.
- **Preserve examples**: Concrete examples, before/after pairs, sample sentences,
  and illustrative ✅/❌ comparisons are MORE valuable than abstract rules.
  When facts contain examples, include them. Never drop an example to make
  room for an abstract restatement of the same point.
- Operations target sections by ``section_id`` (use the ``id`` field of the
  section in CURRENT DOCUMENT, NOT the heading). Block operations target
  blocks by ``index`` (0-based, against the section's current block list).
- **Add** new content with ``append_block``, ``insert_block``, or ``add_section``
  when facts introduce information not yet covered. Prefer extending an
  existing section over creating a new one.
- **Update** existing content with ``replace_block`` or ``replace_section_blocks``
  when new facts provide corrections, updates, or more specific information
  about topics already in the document.
- **Remove** content with ``remove_block`` or ``remove_section`` ONLY when
  the new facts explicitly contradict or supersede it.
- NEVER emit operations whose only effect is to reword unchanged content.
- NEVER emit operations to "normalize" formatting (numbered → bulleted, casing
  changes, paragraph → list, etc).
- Every operation MUST be justifiable by a specific fact in SUPPORTING FACTS.
- Output ``{"operations": []}`` only if the new facts are already reflected
  in the document (e.g., from a concurrent update).

ALLOWED OPERATIONS (each line shows the JSON shape)
- ``{"op": "append_block", "section_id": "...", "block": {...}}``
- ``{"op": "insert_block", "section_id": "...", "index": N, "block": {...}}``
- ``{"op": "replace_block", "section_id": "...", "index": N, "block": {...}}``
- ``{"op": "remove_block", "section_id": "...", "index": N}``
- ``{"op": "add_section", "heading": "...", "level": 2, "blocks": [...], "after_section_id": "..."}``
- ``{"op": "remove_section", "section_id": "..."}``
- ``{"op": "replace_section_blocks", "section_id": "...", "blocks": [...]}``
- ``{"op": "rename_section", "section_id": "...", "new_heading": "..."}``

Block shapes
- ``{"type": "paragraph", "text": "..."}``
- ``{"type": "bullet_list", "items": ["...", "..."]}``
- ``{"type": "ordered_list", "items": ["...", "..."]}``
- ``{"type": "code", "language": "json", "text": "..."}``

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY a single JSON object on its own, with no prose before or after,
no markdown code fences, no commentary. The object must have exactly one
top-level key, ``operations``, whose value is an array of operation objects
(empty array when nothing changes).

Examples
- No changes needed → ``{"operations": []}``
- Add one bullet to an existing "Members" section →
  ``{"operations": [{"op": "append_block", "section_id": "members",
  "block": {"type": "bullet_list", "items": ["Carol — junior engineer"]}}]}``
- Replace a paragraph that has been corrected by new facts →
  ``{"operations": [{"op": "replace_block", "section_id": "overview",
  "index": 0, "block": {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Updated summary."}}]}``
- Remove an obsolete block →
  ``{"operations": [{"op": "remove_block", "section_id": "status", "index": 2}]}``"""

Your task: produce an updated version of the CURRENT DOCUMENT that reflects the new reality, with the MINIMUM possible changes.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Preserve unchanged content BYTE-FOR-BYTE. If a sentence, heading, bullet, code block, or section is still accurate according to the CANDIDATE UPDATE and SUPPORTING FACTS, copy it verbatim — same wording, same punctuation, same whitespace, same markdown structure.
- Do NOT reformat, rephrase, or re-style content that is still accurate. No "light edits for clarity", no reordering for flow, no synonym swaps.
- Remove content that is contradicted by the CANDIDATE UPDATE or SUPPORTING FACTS (stale content).
- Add new content ONLY when the SUPPORTING FACTS contain information not already in the CURRENT DOCUMENT.
- When adding new content, prefer appending to an existing relevant section. Creating a new section is acceptable when the new information does not fit any existing section.
- When creating a new section, match the heading style, tone, and formatting conventions used in the CURRENT DOCUMENT.
- Every assertion in your output MUST be grounded in either (a) the CURRENT DOCUMENT (preserved) or (b) the SUPPORTING FACTS. Never introduce outside knowledge.
- If nothing in the SUPPORTING FACTS contradicts or extends the CURRENT DOCUMENT, return the CURRENT DOCUMENT UNCHANGED, character for character.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output ONLY the updated markdown document. No preamble, no explanation, no diff markers, no commentary.
- Do not wrap the output in code fences unless the CURRENT DOCUMENT itself was entirely a code fence."""
